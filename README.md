## About
We are providing this pre-made module to connect Rad Web Hosting Domain API and [HostBill](https://hostbillapp.com) billing software.

## Installation
1. Download the module via the following [link](https://github.com/Rad-Web-Hosting/hostbill-domain-registrar/releases/latest)
1. Copy the `radwebhosting` directory into the respective HostBill directory in your HostBill setup: `/hostbill/modules/registrars/`
2. In HostBill Admin area, activate the `radwebhosting` registrar
3. Enter your API username and API secret. This information is obtained via your [Hosting Dashboard](https://radwebhosting.com/client_area/clientarea.php).
4. Choose to pay via credit card. You must have one on file. This will ensure domains are registered/renewed when your WHMCS requests. If you do not want to use a credit card, you must have a credit balance on your account with RAD WEB HOSTING.
